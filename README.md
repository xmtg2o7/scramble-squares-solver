# scramble-squares-solver

Scramble Squares Solver is a Python built tool that will iterate through every combination of the given squares and output all available solutions. 

In order to use correctly, one must use 1-4 combined with either an "a" or a "b" to represent their images. I've included a Minnesota Vikings puzzle for reference, it uses a jersey, viking character, "Vikings" spelt out, and a helmet for it's images. 

In the example, I recreated the pieces using "1a" if it was the front part of the jersey, and "1b" if it was the rear. I then used "2a" for the "Vik" portion of "Vikings" and "2b" for the "ings" portion, and so on.

The above example would be listed as 1b, 1a, 4b, 2a. The order needs to be clockwise in order for the puzzle to be solvable. 

Once a solution is found, and there may be a few, it is based on putting the pieces in the following order:

***Disclaimer*** As of 2/5/22, I am currently still working on this. I don't plan on spending more than a month on it. If the code is older than one month and this disclaimer is still up, I have abandonded this project.
