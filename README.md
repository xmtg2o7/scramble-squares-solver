# scramble-squares-solver

Scramble Squares Solver is a Python built tool that will iterate through every combination of the given squares and output all available solutions. 

In order to use correctly, one must use 1-4 combined with either an "a" or a "b" to represent their images. I've included a Minnesota Vikings puzzle for reference, it uses a jersey, viking character, "Vikings" spelt out, and a helmet for it's images. 

In the example, I recreated the pieces using "1a" if it was the front part of the jersey, and "1b" if it was the rear. I then used "2a" for the "Vik" portion of "Vikings" and "2b" for the "ings" portion, and so on.

***Disclaimer*** As of 2/5/22, I am currently still working on this. I don't plan on spending more than a month on it. If the code is older than one month and this disclaimer is still up, I have abandonded this project.
